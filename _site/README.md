# ChROME

**MATLAB(R) scripts implementing statistical closure modeling by the ROMES method**

A novel technique for constructing a statistical closure model for reduced-order models (ROMs) applied to stationary systems is here implemented and tested on both linear and nonlinear stationary systems.

This MATLAB code enables to reproduce the methodology and the numerical experiments presented in the submitted article:
